* Run the `Hello_LUMI_GPU_World.py` Python script using the LUMI PyTorch container on:
  * A login node
  * A LUMI-G compute node
* Pull a container from Dockerhub using Singularity. Make sure the Singularity cache is not filling up your home folder. (HINT: https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/software/containers/singularity/#pulling-container-images-from-a-registry)
* Open an interactive Python interpreter in the LUMI TensorFlow+Horovod container and (successfully) `import horovod.tensorflow`.
