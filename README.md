# Training material for "Moving your AI training jobs to LUMI: A Hands-On Workshop"

The workshop is held in Copenhagen, Denmark, May 29-30, 2024. It is co-organized by the [LUMI User Support Team](https://lumi-supercomputer.eu/user-support/) and the [EuroCC Denmark](https://www.eurocc-access.eu/about-us/meet-the-nccs/ncc-denmark/) and [EuroCC Finland](https://www.eurocc-access.eu/about-us/meet-the-nccs/ncc-finland/) national competence centers. The workshop is hosted by the [Danish e-infrastructure Consortium (DeiC)](https://deic.dk/en/).

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks, jobscripts, and other files related to the examples and hands-on exercises presented with each lecture in the workshop.

## Structure of this repository

All files related to each lecture are placed in a subfolder created for that lecture. Each such subfolder contains an `README.md` file that list the examples and exercises for that lecture.

Additionally, the `bonus_material` subfolder contains training material that is not related to a specific lecture but rather the workshop in its entirety. Each such "set" of bonus material is placed in its own subfolder to the `bonus_material` folder.
