# Training Material for the "Getting started with AI on LUMI" workshop

Jupyter notebooks, jobscripts, and other files related to the examples and hands-on exercises presented with each lecture.

## Structure of this repository

All files related to each lecture are placed in a subfolder created for that lecture. Each such subfolder contains an `index.md` file that list the examples and exercises for that lecture.

Additionally, the `bonus_material` subfolder contains training material that is not related to a specific lecture but rather the workshop in its entirety. Each such "set" of bonus material is placed in its own subfolder to the `bonus_material` folder.
